## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jomar Rumbawa and I'm a Frontend Developer who is currently studying on Scrimba. I'm currently interested in anything pertaining to web development. My goal is to be hired full-time and also be able to work on open-source projects that are involved with free education. Outside of coding I love traveling, eating food, watching sports and going to the gym. If you'd like to get ahold of me scroll down a bit to see my socials!
